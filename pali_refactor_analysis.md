# Pali Wallet Refactor Analysis: Performance, UX, and Robustness Review

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of [PR #702](https://github.com/syscoin/pali-wallet/pull/702/files) and the sysweb3 ecosystem, Pali Wallet has undergone significant refactoring that demonstrates substantial improvements in performance, user experience, and robustness. The changes position the wallet well for exponential growth as a flexible UTXO/EVM multi-chain solution.

## Major Performance Improvements

### 1. Unified Polling System & Resource Management
**Location**: `source/scripts/Background/handlers/handlePaliUpdates.ts`

- **Improvement**: Introduced `checkForUpdates()` unified polling system replacing scattered update mechanisms
- **Impact**: Reduces redundant API calls and improves state synchronization
- **Smart Optimization**: Only updates when balance changes or pending transactions exist
- **Background Resilience**: Handles connection failures gracefully with automatic state persistence

### 2. Cancellable Promise Architecture
**Location**: `MainController.ts` - `createCancellablePromise()`

- **Advanced Network Switching**: Implements cancellable promises to prevent race conditions during network switching
- **Memory Efficiency**: Proper cleanup of cancelled operations prevents memory leaks

- **Robustness**: Handles concurrent network change requests elegantly

### 3. State Persistence Optimizations
**Location**: `source/state/store.ts` & `paliStorage.ts`

- **Efficient State Comparison**: Uses `lodash.isEqual` to avoid unnecessary state writes
- **Reduced I/O Operations**: Only persists state when actual changes occur
- **Background Sync**: Maintains state consistency across extension lifecycle events

### 4. Optimistic UI Updates
- **Network Switching**: Immediately updates UI while background processes complete
- **Account Switching**: Instant UI feedback with background data loading
- **Loading State Management**: Smart loading panels that prevent blank screen issues

## UX & Interface Improvements

## Robustness & Security Enhancements

### 1. Network Retry Mechanisms
**Enhanced Error Handling**:
- Exponential backoff for failed network requests
- Rate limit detection and appropriate delays
- Comprehensive timeout handling
- Graceful degradation for slow connections

### 2. Multi-Keyring Architecture Stability
**Based on memory analysis**:
- Fixed "Cannot switch between different UTXO networks" error
- Proper keyring session transfer mechanisms
- Enhanced memory management with secure buffer implementations
- Reduced attack surface for sensitive data

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP) Compliance
- **MV3 Compatibility**: Removed unsafe evaluations and inline scripts
- **Security Hardening**: Stricter CSP policies without functionality loss
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Consistent behavior across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge

### 4. Transaction Cache Unification
- **Unified TX Cache**: Single transaction caching system across UTXO/EVM
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced memory footprint for transaction history
- **State Consistency**: Prevents transaction state desynchronization

## Build & Development Optimizations

### 1. Webpack Configuration Improvements
**Location**: `source/config/webpack.common.js`

- **Code Splitting**: Strategic chunking for app/external entry points
- **Bundle Optimization**: Terser with console.log removal in production
- **Asset Management**: Improved static asset handling and copying

### 2. Manifest V3 Optimizations
